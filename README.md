# Pizza Sales Analysis - 2015

Welcome to the Pizza Sales Analysis project for the year 2015! This repository contains SQL queries and a Power BI Dashboard for analyzing and visualizing pizza sales data from the year 2015.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of pizza sales data specifically for the year 2015. The analysis involves SQL queries to match the data and gather insights, which are then visualized through a Power BI Dashboard.

## Project Structure

- **SQL Queries**: The repository includes SQL queries used to extract, manipulate, and match the pizza sales data for the year 2015. These queries are designed to retrieve relevant information for analysis.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Utilizing the insights gathered from SQL queries, a Power BI Dashboard has been created. This dashboard provides interactive visualizations and reports to comprehend the sales trends, customer behavior, and other key metrics related to pizza sales in 2015.

## Repository Contents
